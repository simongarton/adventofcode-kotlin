## Advent of Code - Kotlin style !

On day 5 I realised now would be a great time to take a look at Kotlin.

So what I'm doing is following my main Java project - which we're doing at work,
and it's highly competitive - and reproducing the answers in Kotlin.

### Day 3 : Mull It Over

Knowing I should use regex - and having learned it after I'd done this one in Java - this was fun. Some
handling of nulls was learned.

### Day 2 : Red-Nosed Reports

Some array manipulation was learned.

### Day 1 : Historian Hysteria

Early days, but it's nice and clean.
