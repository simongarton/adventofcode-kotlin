## Advent of Code - Kotlin style !

On day 5 I realised now would be a great time to take a look at Kotlin.

So what I'm doing is following my main Java project - which we're doing at work,
and it's highly competitive - and reproducing the answers in Kotlin.

### Day 2 : Red-Nosed Reports

Some array manipulation was learned.

### Day 1 : Historian Hysteria

Early days, but it's nice and clean.
